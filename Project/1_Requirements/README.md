# Introduction
Todays modern houses are equipped with many different technological facilities like
- Automatic lights and fans
- Remote operated curtains
And many more such systems. An automatic gate for garage or main entrance gate of compound is one of the very popular, useful and widely used one such facility. Automatic gate means it opens automatically when any one wants to enter or exit and then it closes automatically. It is equipped with sensor that detects person/two wheeler / four wheeler (or any other object) and on detecting, it opens the gate and after few seconds the gate is automatically closed. The sensors are given on both side of gate one is inside the gate and another is outside the gate. So gate automatically open from either side when anybody wants to enter or exit.



# Purpose

Whether residential or commercial, need to have security parameters installed along their perimeters or boundaries. These security parameters come in the form of fences and gates




# Requirements
## High level  requirements


| ID | Descriptions|
|----|-------------|
| HLR1| The IR sensor should sense the vehicle/object and pass signal to controller|
|HLR2|The DC motor will open/close gate when bject/vehicle detects|
|HLR3| LED should on/off according to the signal |



## Low level requirements

|ID| Description|
|----|------------|
|LLR1|When the gate is closed. The red LED is ON to indicate gate is closed |
|LLR2|When any object comes in front of inside sensor (or outside sensor) it generates an interrupt. It is indicated by blue LED |
|LLR3|The motor rotates and opens the gate. The red LED turns off and green LED turns ON|
|LLR4|After the pass of the object Again green LED turns off and red LED turns on|

# Who
- Users who need to automate their needs.



# What
- Automatic gates are used to control access into a secured area when any one wants to enter or exit and then it closes automatically

# When

- With gates being the point of entry and exit, due attention should be given to them when planning a propertyâ€™s security parameters.

# Where  

- Automatic gates are widely used in residential, commercial, and industrial areas for restricting access
