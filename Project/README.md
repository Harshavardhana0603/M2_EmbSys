#                     FIRE ALARM USING AVR MICROCONTROLLER



#### Abstract:

An automatic gate for garage or main entrance gate of compound is one of the very popular, useful and widely used one such facility. Automatic gate means it opens automatically when any one wants to enter or exit and then it closes automatically. It is equipped with sensor that detects person/two wheeler / four wheeler (or any other object) and on detecting, it opens the gate and after few seconds the gate is automatically closed. The sensors are given on both side of gate one is inside the gate and another is outside the gate. So gate automatically open from either side when anybody wants to enter or exit.

Here the given project demonstrates the same system. It uses IR object sensor to detect any object or person, and a low RPM DC gear motor that opens and closes the gate. The project is build using AVR micro controller ATMega16. Let us see the circuit its working and operation




#### Advantages:

1. Privacy: Privacy is important for every family. Choosing a suitable driveway gate for your property is the best way to protect your and your family’s privacy from the outsiders



2. Safety: Automatic gates provide the convenience of allowing homeowners to control entrance and exit of their home. So you can create boundaries for your pets and children and avoid severe consequences surrounding traffic and other dangers that may create harm.




3. Convenience: Automatic gates offer you convenience of not having to physically open the gate in order to gain entry in your home.



4. Cost-Effective: it will also increase the value of your home and will quickly catch potential buyers’ eyes when your house is for sale.
