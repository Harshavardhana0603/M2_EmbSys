# Abstract

In this project, we are going to make a Fire Alert System using ATMEGA8 microcontroller and fire sensor. Fire sensor can be of any type, however we are using IR (Infrared) based Fire Sensor. Although IR based Fire Sensors have some disadvantages mostly of inaccuracy, it is the cheapest and easiest way to detect fire.

IR Based Fire sensors have lesser sensing vision, so we are going to mount the fire sensor on a servo motor.
The Servo will be making 180 degrees pendulum rotations. With the Fire sensor mounted on it, we get a 270+ degrees fire sensing vision.
The servo will be rotating continuously thus giving a complete room fire alert system. For more accuracy we can add a smoke sensor to the system. 
With that we could get higher accuracy.


# Advantages


- Fire alarms are devices that are proven to save lives and are one of the most major investments your business and company can make.

- A fire alarm also called as a smoke detector or a smoke alarm basically emits a signal, whether it is a horn, siren or buzzer, as an alert or warning that a fire has started in the premises.


- Fire alarms can save you money on your house insurance to a large extent. Many of the homeowner policies provide amazing discounts to customers who have these systems in their home.


-  A fire alarm system provides homeowners with 24/7 protection all through the day
