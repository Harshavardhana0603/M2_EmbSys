The components used in this project are:

- 5v power supply : A power supply is an electrical device that supplies electric power to an electrical load. The main purpose of a power supply is to convert electric current from a source to the correct voltage.

- Servo motor (sg90):Servo motors (or servos) are self-contained electric devices that rotate or push parts of a machine with great precision.

- ATMEGA8:  An ATMega Microcontroller is an 8-bit microcontroller with Reduced Instruction Set (RISC) based Harvard Architecture.

- BUZZER: An arduino buzzer is also called a piezo buzzer. It is basically a tiny speaker that you can connect directly to an Arduino

- Button, 10KΩ resistor, 1KΩ resistor, 220Ω resistor, 100nF capacitor.
