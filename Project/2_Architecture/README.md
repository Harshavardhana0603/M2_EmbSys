# Components

- Power supply: A power supply is an electrical device that supplies electric power to an electrical load. The main purpose of a power supply is to convert electric current from a source to the correct voltage, current, and frequency to power the load.

- Microcontroller: Atmega16: ATMEGA16 microcontroller is one of the popular controllers in AVR series. With its features and purchase cost, it became one of favorite controller for both hobbyists and engineers. ATMEGA16 programming is similar to any other AVR controller.  It is particularly a clone to ATMEGA32 except for the memory.

- LED: LED is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons. The color of the light (corresponding to the energy of the photons) is determined by the energy required for electrons to cross the band gap of the semiconducto

- IR sensor : An infrared (IR) sensor is an electronic device that measures and detects infrared radiation in its surrounding environment. Infrared radiation was accidentally discovered by an astronomer named William Herchel in 1800. While measuring the temperature of each color of light (separated by a prism), he noticed that the temperature just beyond the red light was highest.



- DC Motor : A DC motor is any of a class of rotary electrical motors that converts direct current electrical energy into mechanical energy. The most common types rely on the forces produced by magnetic fields. Nearly all types of DC motors have some internal mechanism, either electromechanical or electronic, to periodically change the direction of current in part of the motor.


- Resistor , Voltage source
